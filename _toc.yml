# Notes:
# - Files are specified without the .md extension.
# - The file `doxygen_mainpage.md` has been omitted as it's typically for Doxygen generation, not direct reading.
# - The file `cute/index.rst` has been omitted. You may need to convert it or link to it appropriately from within the CUTE markdown files if its content is essential.
# - This structure is a suggestion; feel free to reorder files and captions based on your preferred narrative flow.
# - Ensure this _toc.yml file is placed in the root directory alongside your source files (or one level up if your content is in a subfolder specified in _config.yml).
